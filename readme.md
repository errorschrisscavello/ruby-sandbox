# Ruby Sandbox

This is just a small sample project used to demonstrate some core ruby features as well as a testing ground for Sinatra. It utilizes the basic directory and file structure for Sinatra.

It also makes use of some nifty helper functions and Google Code Prettify to display the code with syntax highlighting.

This is by no means a web application, just a sandbox and example.

To run the project navigate to the root directory and run:

`$ ruby server.rb`
